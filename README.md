#### About

Mobile Detect is a lightweight PHP class for detecting mobile devices (including tablets).
It uses the User-Agent string combined with specific HTTP headers to detect the mobile environment.

*Why*

Your website's _content strategy_ is important! You need a complete toolkit to deliver an experience that is _optimized_, 
_fast_ and _relevant_ to your users. Mobile Detect class is a 
[server-side detection](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/#bp-devcap-detection) tool that can help you with your RWD strategy, 
it is not a replacement for CSS3 media queries or other forms of client-side feature detection.

*How*

We're committed to make Mobile_Detect the best open-source mobile detection resource and this is why before 
each release we're running [unit tests](./tests) and research and update the detection rules on **monthly** basis.

*Who*

See [the history](./docs/HISTORY.md) of the project.

#### Announcements

:point_right: Keep `Mobile_Detect.php` class in a separate `module` and do NOT include it in your script core because of the high frequency of updates.
:point_right: When including the class into your `web application` or `module` always use `include_once '../path/to/Mobile_Detect.php` to prevent conflicts.

**WordPress**

* [Mobile Detect for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinywp-mobile-detect/) - WordPress has a built-in function

Mobile Detect PHP library!
